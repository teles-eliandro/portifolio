PORTIFOLIO

Description

Welcome to my first portfolio project! This repository showcases my journey in web development, created using the skills I acquired from Alura's HTML and CSS courses.
This portfolio serves as a practical application of my learning, featuring a clean and responsive design that highlights my work and skills. Here, you will find:

HTML Structure: Well-organized and semantic markup for optimal accessibility and SEO.
CSS Styling: A visually appealing layout that demonstrates my understanding of design principles and responsive web design.
Responsive Design: The portfolio is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Feel free to explore the project, provide feedback, or use it as inspiration for your own work!
